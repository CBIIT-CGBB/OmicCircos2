# OmicCircos
[OmicCircos](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/OmicCircos.html) was at bioconductor.

# Introduction
The OmicCircos package generates high-quality circular plots for visualizing variations in omics data. The associated publication was **"OmicCircos: A Simple-to-Use R Package for the Circular Visualization of Multidimensional Omics Data"** on [Cancer Informatics 2014](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.4137/CIN.S13495).

# Input file formats
Four input data files are used in the package: segment data, mapping data, link data and link polygon data. Segment data are required to draw the anchor circular track. The remaining three data sets are used to draw additional tracks or connections.
